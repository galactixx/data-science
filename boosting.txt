Ada-boost (when used in regression) starts off with creating a small tree or stump. The final say this tree has on the final output is based on how well it compensated for the previous errors.
Then ada-boost builds another stump based on the errors from the previous stump. And it continues to make stumps until it has made the number of trees specified in the hyperparameter or if it has perfect fit.
